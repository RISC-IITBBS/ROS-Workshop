# Steps to Create a ROS Package
1. First, navigate to the source space directory of the catkin workspace youâ€™ve created.
```bash
 cd ~/catkin_ws/src
```

2. Now, use the `catkin_create_pkg` script to create a new package called pkg_ros_basics which depends on std_msgs, roscpp, and rospy:
```bash
catkin_create_pkg pkg_ros_basics std_msgs rospy roscpp
```

This will create a beginner_tutorials folder which contains a `package.xml` and a `CMakeLists.txt`, which have been partially filled out with the information you gave catkin_create_pkg.

`catkin_create_pkg` requires that you give it a package_name and optionally a list of dependencies on which that package depends:
```bash
catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]
```
Now, you need to build the packages in the catkin workspace:
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```
3. Inside the package, there are `src` folder, package.xml, CMakeLists.txt, and the include folders.

CMakeLists.txt: This file has all the commands to build the ROS source code inside the package and
create the executable. For more information about CMakeLists you can rosWiki.

package.xml: This is an XML file. It mainly contains the package dependencies, information, and
so forth.

src: The source code of ROS packages is kept in this folder.
